# TheRFrameworkWPFTemplate
A simple project (exportable as a template) for setting up MVVM projects, using my BaseViewModel/Command/etc classes, as well as a help window, window manager, theme manager, etc

# How to export as a template
Idk if i can upload templates to github, they might have some weird dependencies so it's better if you export it yourself.

Goto: 
- Project>Export Template
