# TheRFrameworkWPFTemplate
A simple project (exportable as a template) for setting up MVVM projects, using my BaseViewModel/Command/etc classes, as well as a help window, window manager, theme manager, etc.
This is a .NET Framework 4.6.1 template btw.
# How to export as a template
Idk if i can upload templates to github, they might have some weird dependencies so it's better if you export it yourself.

- First, Goto: Project>Export Template
- Select 'Project template', then 'TheRFrameworldWPFTemplate' at the bottom (it wont name your applications as this, due to the $safeprojectname$ in most files.
- Click next
- Template name can be anything, mine is set as: "TheRFrameworkWPFTemplate", description can be whatever you want too. mine is set as "A template for creating WPF MVVM applications"
-- If you want a custom icon, you can set that too. i think it copies it into the resources folder when you create a project, but i haven't tested it so idk
-- idk what preview image is...
-- You can just leave output location as it is (in my docszvs2019\exported templates\(templatename).zip)
-- Leave the 2 options at the bottom as checked
-- Click finished, and thats it :))
